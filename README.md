# Data-Partitioning

Libraries used: Good old basic ones:
`json`, `os`, `time`, `datetime`

### Objective

The main purpose was to query through the file. You will find the first part of the code is quering through the original format data and it takes about 2.5 seconds on an average. The second part is partitioning the origianl data based on dates. And the last third part of the code is again quering the same thing as I did in first part and now it takes 0.2 seconds on average.
